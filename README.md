# Disarm
Ability to Disarm Peds just like GTA 4 and RDR 2 has.

### Description:
This mod ingeniously resurrects a beloved feature from Rockstar's previous games, IV and Red Dead Redemption, and seamlessly integrates it into the world of GTA V. Users can now relive the thrill of disarming enemies by shooting weapons out of their hands, just like in the old days. Say goodbye to the frustration of Rockstar's omission, as this mod brings back the excitement of tactical combat encounters where precision and finesse matter as much as firepower.

Installation is a breeze â€“ simply place the Disarm.dll file into your "scripts" folder, ensuring you have the latest Script Hook V and .NET Script Hook installed. Once set up, prepare to immerse yourself in a gameplay experience reminiscent of the classics.

### About:
It's a testament to the passion of the modding community that this feature, inexplicably absent from GTA V, has been lovingly resurrected. Why Rockstar chose to remove such a dynamic gameplay mechanic is a mystery, but thanks to this mod, players can once again enjoy the thrill of disarming foes with pinpoint accuracy. Whether you prefer the satisfaction of shooting weapons out of hands or the finesse of using a stun gun, this mod offers versatile ways to neutralize threats while adding depth to your gameplay.

## Situations:
1. Imagine the thrill of a high-speed chase through the streets of Los Santos. As you pursue a fleeing criminal, you spot an opportunity to level the playing field. With precise aim, you take a shot, disarming the suspect and forcing them to rethink their strategy.
2. In a tense standoff with rival gang members, you find yourself outnumbered and outgunned. But with the Disarm mod at your disposal, you turn the tables on your adversaries. One by one, you systematically disarm them, leaving them defenseless and at your mercy.
3. During a heated exchange with law enforcement, you opt for a non-lethal approach. Armed with a stun gun, you incapacitate officers by shooting their weapons out of their hands, allowing for a peaceful resolution to the conflict while still asserting your authority.
4. As you roam the city streets, you witness a pedestrian being harassed by an armed assailant. With quick reflexes, you intervene, disarming the attacker and restoring peace to the neighborhood. In gratitude, the pedestrian rewards you with valuable information or a heartfelt thank you.
